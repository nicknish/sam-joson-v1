## Useful Tips

- If you make edits to your Contentful space while running `gatsby develop` you will need to stop it and rerun the command to see the changes reflected. For example a new post or page will not automatically show up until the website has been rebuilt.
- The template assumes you have at least **one page**, **one post** and **one tag** in Contentful. If you do not the website will fail to build.
- The SEO component assumes you have entered at least one meta description in Contentful for a post and one for a page. If you do not the website will fail to build.
- **DO NOT** store your Contentful access tokens or space ids anywhere in GitHub. Treat them like passwords.
